  - name: Actions
    text: |-
      Units (such as heroes) have a move action and standard action, in that order, plus a quick action.
      Move moves up to speed (see range)
      Character's active abilities are standard actions by default.
      Quick actions are marked with quick.
      An action being "Default" makes no difference by default, but is treated differently by some rules.
  - name: Range
    text: |-
      Range is counting squares. One square can be diagonally adjacent, the rest must be orthogonal.
      Burst n means all squares within n range of the target square.
      Line n means all squares in an orthogonal line of n squares from the target square.
      Path n means all squares in a path of n squares from the target square.
  - name: Attacking
    text: |-
      By default attacks hit with no roll. Only roll when a roll could affect the result somehow.
      â›¨ can be applied to the attack. A die must be rolled over the â›¨ to hit.
      âš” is damage.
      Crit can be applied to the attack. If the die is rolled at least 7-crit, the attack deals double damage.
