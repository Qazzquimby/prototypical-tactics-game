rules:
  - name: Overview
    text: |-
      A quick skirmish game played over 6 rounds, focused on discovering synergies and counters.
      It trades some depth of simulation for speed of play.
  - name: Setup Game
    text: |-
      Pick 3ish sets.
      Draw a map from among the sets and reveal it.
      Draw 12 heroes from among the sets and reveal them.
      Player 1 makes two groups of 6. Player 2 picks a group, and Player 1 gets the other.
      Players alternate picking one of their heroes and putting it on the map in their deploy zone, until each player has placed 4.
      The remaining heroes are unused.
  - name: Battle
    text: |-
      Dice can be used to track health and other resources.
      Battle lasts 6 rounds (or until concession).
      Heroes activate in order from left to right.
      P1's first character, P2's first character, P1's second character, P2's second character, etc.
      
      A team scores 1 point when an enemy hero dies (and lose that point if the hero is somehow resurrected).
      Many sets add additional ways to score points.
  - name: Actions
    text: |-
      Units (such as heroes) have a Move Action and Standard Action, which they can use in any order.
      A Standard action can be used to take a Move action.
      A "Basic Move" Move Action moves orthogonally up to the unit's speed.
      
      All active abilities are Standard Actions by default.
      
      Actions listed on a unit's card are called "Default Actions".
  - name: Range
    text: |-
      Range is counting squares. One square can be diagonally adjacent, the rest must be orthogonal.
      Burst n means all squares within n range of the target square.
      Adjacent is range 1.
      Line n means all squares in an orthogonal line of n squares from the target square.
      Path n means all squares in a path of n squares from the target square.
  - name: Attacking
    text: |-
      - By default attacks hit with no roll. Only roll when a roll could affect the result somehow.
      - Different target units get different rolls.
      - â›¨ can be applied to the attack. A die must be rolled over the â›¨ to hit. On miss the attack continues but cannot affect that target.
      - Crit can be applied to the attack. If the attack hits and the die landed on one of the [Crit] highest values, the attack is a crit.
      - Crits deal +1x damage.
      - âš” indicates damage dealt.
  - name: Targeting
    text: |-
      - If an ability targets an area (burst, 2x2, etc), by default it targets all spaces in that area.
      - A target may choose to be hit, even if an attack would miss them.
      - By default everything can affect both allies and enemies, and will specify otherwise.
      - Technically spaces are targeted, not units. "The unit is targeted" means "the unit's space is targeted".
        - E.g. If, after you declared your attack, the target swapped places with your healer, you'd hit your healer.
        - Targeting empty spaces can be useful, like shooting a rocket to hit that deals splash damage to an enemy around a corner.
      - If a unit is "untargetable", its space cannot be targeted except things that target all in an area.
      - If something would block line of sight to your target after you declare the attack, the attack hits the blocker instead.
  - name: Line of Sight
    text: |-
      Effects nearly always need line of Sight to their target.
      To have Line of sight to a square, you must be able to draw a line from any corner of your square to any corner of the target square, 
      without touching any blocking terrain, including their corners.
      
      All units block line of sight, even allies.
  - name: Rounding
    text: |-
      All division is rounded up.
      X per Y is rounded down, such as "take 1 damage per 2 spaces moved".

shared_rules:
  Instant: &RuleInstant
    name: Instant
    text: |-
      May list a reaction speed target, like "Instant +2" or "Instant +1"
      An ability marked as Instant can be used for free at the start of any turn, or when a unit is targeted.

      When reacting to to a targeting Action, declare before the roll is made.
      If the roll is higher than the target's â›¨ + the Instant's bonus (if any), the Instant occurs after the triggering Action.
      Otherwise, the Instant occurs before the triggering Action.
      If the triggering actor is an ally, you may choose whether the Instant triggers before or after the Action.

      Note that the Instant's bonus does not modify the target's â›¨ - it only changes how easy it is to act first.
      Reminder that units can choose to be hit even when an attack roll fails.
  Ultimate: &RuleUltimate

  Flying: &RuleFlying

      Flying movement ignores terrain and does not provoke reactions.
  Facing: &RuleFacing
    name: Facing
    text: |-
      When a unit specifically states it has facing, when it acts, indicate that it faces an orthogonal direction most closely facing the direction or target of the Action.
      You can have the character partly overhang that edge of the square to indicate facing.
      Spaces to its front and the orthogonal line at its left and right are in front of it. Other spaces are behind it.

    text: |-
      Double yellow line indicates the square with the second line is higher than the square bordering it.
      Units can move from freely from high to low, but the line is impassible from low to high.
      When counting range, the Height Difference counts as 2 extra spaces.
      A height difference is also Cover.
  FallingHazard: &RuleFallingHazard
    name: Falling Hazard
    text: |-
      Purple area indicates a pit. 
      Units standing on a pit cannot move. 
      Units that end their turn on a pit are destroyed.

      Some units may be able to escape by flying or teleporting.
  Cover: &RuleCover
    name: Cover
    text: |-
      Green lines indicate cover. Cover can be moved through.
      Cover makes it harder to attack if you're not adjacent to it. 
      If a unit isn't next to the cover, their Line of Sight only travels one space past it.
  CriticalMoment: &RuleCriticalMoment

  CapturePoint: &RuleCapturePoint
    name: Capture Point
    text: |-
      An orange area is a capture point.
      At the end of each round (after all units have acted), a team with more units in the capture point claims it. Mark it with the team's color.
      Then if one team owns more points than the other, they score 1 point.
      If there are multiple control points and one team controls all of them, they score 2 points instead.
      
      Points remain claimed until the other team claims them.
