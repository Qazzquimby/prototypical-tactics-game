rules:
  - name: Overview
    text: |-
      A quick skirmish game played over 3 battles of 6 rounds.
      Focuses on discovering synergies and counters.
      Often attacking has no rolls. Some depth is traded for speed of play.
  - name: Setup Game
    text: |-
      Pick up to 3 sets.
      Draw 3 maps and 12 heroes evenly from those sets.
      Shuffle and reveal the maps and their order.
      Draft the heroes according the draft card.
      Each time you play on a map is a battle. Some things last between battles.
      Game is playing best of 3 battles.

    text: |-
      Take turns deploying a hero in your deploy zone and placing their cards on the table.
      Maybe track health and other resources with dice.
      Battle lasts 6 rounds (or until concede).
      Heroes activate in order from left to right.
      P1's first character, P2's first character, P1's second character, P2's second character, etc.
  - name: Actions
    text: |-
      Units (such as heroes) have a move action and standard action, in that order, plus a quick action.
      Move moves up to speed (see range)
      Character's active abilities are standard actions by default.
      Quick actions are marked with quick.
      An action being "Default" makes no difference by default, but is treated differently by some rules.
  - name: Range
    text: |-
      Range is counting squares. One square can be diagonally adjacent, the rest must be orthogonal.
      Burst n means all squares within n range of the target square.
      Line n means all squares in an orthogonal line of n squares from the target square.
      Path n means all squares in a path of n squares from the target square.
  - name: Attacking
    text: |-
      By default attacks hit with no roll. Only roll when a roll could affect the result somehow.
      â›¨ can be applied to the attack. A die must be rolled over the â›¨ to hit.
      âš” is damage.
      Crit can be applied to the attack. If the die is rolled at least 7-crit, the attack deals double damage.
      
      The target may also choose to be hit when an attack would miss them.
      By default effects have friendly fire, and will specify otherwise.
      
      Attacks typically target spaces rather than characters. E.g. If the target swapped places with your healer, you'd hit your healer.
  - name: Line of Sight
    text: |-
      Effects nearly always need line of Sight to their target. Line of sight is drawn from the center of the source square to the center of the target square.
      Enemies characters and some terrain blocks line of sight.
  - name: Persistent
    text: |-
      Lasts between Battles, until end of game.
      Eg a Persistent debuff would continue into later battles.

          May list a reaction speed target, like "Instant â›¨+2" or "Instant â›¨+1"
          An ability marked as Instant can be used for free at the start of any turn, or when a unit is targeted.
          
          When reacting to to a targeting action, declare before the roll is made.
          If the roll is higher than the target's defense + the Instant's bonus (if any), the Instant occurs after the action.
          Otherwise, the Instant occurs before the action.
          If the actor is an ally, you may choose whether the Instant triggers before or after the action.

          Note that the Instant's defense bonus does not modify the target's defense - it only changes how easy it is to act first.
          Reminder that units can choose to be hit even when an attack roll fails.

              Give the target a Duat token and +1 stress.
              The effect depends on the number of Duat tokens the target has.
              - If they have 1 token, force them to move up to their speed under you control. It counts as voluntary movement.
              - If they have 2 tokens, they are Slowed and Impaired.
              - If they have 3 tokens, they skip their next activation.
              - If they have 4 tokens, remove them, and until the end of their next turn, they are on your team (swap ally/hostile). You control their next activation, during which you cannot use any x/Game actions.
