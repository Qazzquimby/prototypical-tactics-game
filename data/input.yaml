#  - name: Overview
#    text: |-
#      A quick skirmish game played over 6 rounds, focused on discovering synergies and counters.
#      It trades some depth of simulation for speed of play.
#  - name: Setup Game
#    text: |-
#      Pick 3ish sets.
#      Draw a map from among the sets and reveal it.
#      Draw 12 heroes from among the sets and reveal them.
#      Player 1 makes two groups of 6. Player 2 picks a group, and Player 1 gets the other.
#      Players alternate picking one of their heroes and putting it on the map in their deploy zone, until each player has placed 4.
#      The remaining heroes are unused.
#  - name: Game
#    text: |-
#      Dice can be used to track health and other resources.
#      Game lasts 6 rounds (or until concession).
#      Heroes activate in order from left to right.
#      P1's first character, P2's first character, P1's second character, P2's second character, etc.
#
#      A team scores 1 point when an enemy hero dies (and lose that point if the hero is somehow resurrected).
#      Many sets add additional ways to score points.
#  - name: Actions
#    text: |-
#      Units (such as heroes) have a Move Action and Standard Action, which they can use in any order.
#      A Standard action can be used to take a Move action.
#      A "Basic Move" Move Action moves non-diagonally up to the unit's speed.
#
#      All active abilities are Standard Actions by default.
#
#      Actions listed on a unit's card are called "Default Actions".
#  - name: Range
#    text: |-
#      Range is counting squares. One square can be diagonally adjacent, the rest must be non-diagonal.
#      Burst n means all squares within n range of the target square.
#      Adjacent is range 1.
#      Line n means all squares in an non-diagonal line of n squares from the target square.
#      Path n means all squares in a path of n squares from the target square.
#  - name: Attacking
#    text: |-
#      - By default attacks hit with no roll. Only roll when a roll could affect the result somehow.
#      - Different target units get different rolls.
#      - Def can be applied to the attack. A die must be rolled over the Def value to hit. On miss the attack continues but cannot affect that target.
#      - Crit can be applied to the attack. If the attack hits and the die landed on one of the [Crit] highest values, the attack is a crit.
#      - Crits deal +100% damage.
#  - name: Targeting
#    text: |-
#      - If an ability affects an area (burst, 2x2, etc), by default it includes all spaces in that area. This is not targeting.
#      - A unit may choose to be hit, even if an attack would miss them.
#      - By default everything can affect both allies and enemies, and will specify otherwise.
#      - Technically spaces are targeted, not units. "The unit is targeted" means "the unit's space is targeted".
#        - E.g. If, after you declared your attack, the target swapped places with your healer, you'd hit your healer.
#        - Targeting empty spaces can be useful, like shooting a rocket to hit that deals splash damage to an enemy around a corner.
#      - If a unit is "untargetable", its space cannot be targeted except things that target all in an area.
#      - If something would block line of sight to your target after you declare the attack, the attack hits the blocker instead.
#  - name: Line of Sight
#    text: |-
#      Effects nearly always need line of Sight to their target.
#      To have Line of sight to a square, you must be able to draw a line from any corner of your square to any corner of the target square,
#      without touching any blocking terrain, including their corners.
#
#      All units block line of sight, even allies.
#  - name: Rounding
#    text: |-
#      All division is rounded up.
#      X per Y is rounded down, such as "take 1 damage per 2 spaces moved".

      Usually the direction a unit is facing isn't tracked.

      Spaces to its front and the line at its left and right are in front of it. Other spaces are behind it.

      You ignore terrain and your movement does not provoke reactions.
      Flying movement gives you flying during the movement.
  ImmobileHint: &ImmobileHint
    name: Immobile
    text: You cannot move voluntarily. You are undefendable.
  InstantHint: &InstantHint
    name: Instant
    text: |-
      An Instant can be used for free at the start of any turn, or when a unit is targeted or included in an AoE, after any attack roll.
      
      The instant may have a modifier value, like "Instant +2". If it doesn't, the instant happens immediately before the ability resolves.
      
      If the instant does have a modifier, the attacker rolls against the attack roll def (0 for undefendable or aoe) + the modifier.
      If the roll is higher, the Instant occurs after the triggering Action.
      Else the roll is equal or lower, and the Instant occurs before the triggering Action.

      If the triggering actor is an ally, you may simply choose whether the Instant triggers before or after the Action.

      Reminder that units can choose to be hit even when an attack roll fails.
  IrreducibleHint: &IrreducibleHint

  UnprotectedHint: &UnprotectedHint

  SilenceHint: &SilenceHint

      You cannot use non-default abilities. Clear at the end of your next turn.
  MarkHint: &MarkHint
    name: Mark
    text: |-
      A Mark is any token that either --
      - contains "Mark" in its name
      - or that is given by an enemy and causes increased damage received or undefendable.
      For example, slow causes undefendable, so a slow caused by an enemy is a mark.
  ### maps
  CapturePointHint: &CapturePointHint
    name: Capture Point Objective (orange shade)
    text: |-
      If a team has more units than the other team standing on an capture point, they own it.
      If a capture point has no units from any team, it stays claimed by the last team that owned it.
      If teams have an equal (non-0) number of units on a capture point, it is unowned.
      At end of round, if a team owns more capture points, they score 1 point.
      If there are 3 or more capture points, and a team owns all of them, they score 1 more point.
  CoverHint: &CoverHint

  DeadlyFallHint: &DeadlyFallHint

      If a unit ends their turn on this, they die. Leaving a falling hazard space costs +1 movement.
  HazardHint: &HazardHint
    name: Hazard
    text: |-
      Once per turn per hazard space, if a unit enters the space or ends their turn on the space, they take 1dmg.
      Some hazards may have different effects instead of 1dmg.
  HeightDifference: &HeightDifferenceHint
    name: Height Difference (yellow line)
    text: |-
      The yellow line has arrows in one direction, pointing down. Units cannot move "up" the line.
      Range 1 does not reach over the line, though other ranges are unaffected.
      Units on the ground can see the top, but not the ground on the other side. Units on top are unaffected.
      Provides cover to units on the ground.
